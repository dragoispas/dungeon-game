Ideas
=====

- make water blocks in the game and player will be able to freeze them
- kind of magicka vibe
- spells that combine
- tracking projectiles / expliding / freezing / fire
- item system similar to LoL (basic items that combine in bigger ones with different passives)



To Do
====

- explosion for fire element
- slow and freeze (increase drag, when drag reaches x, freeze)
- debuff and knockback for void



===

### Projectile along with it's element is created and initialized in ProjectileController.cs

### Projectile.cs sets the projectile parameters recieved from controller and also manages triggers

### Enemy.cs will handle all damage functions and other elemental blights. Projectile.cs will call damage functions.
