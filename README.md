Ideas
=====

- make water blocks in the game and player will be able to freeze them
- kind of magicka vibe
- spells that combine
- tracking projectiles / expliding / freezing / fire
- item system similar to LoL (basic items that combine in bigger ones with different passives)



To Do
====

- cannotSpawnLRoomBottomLeft and other 3 not working properly, commented them for now (will always only spawn 4 L rooms because cannotSpawn goes true after first spawn even though it should be able to spawn more)

- first room does not open and close doors - make it so it only opens and closes doors in the active room where the player is

- add the new tiles to all room types - only L rooms left to be done


- add shadows to walls
