Ideas
=====

- make water blocks in the game and player will be able to freeze them
- kind of magicka vibe
- spells that combine
- tracking projectiles / expliding / freezing / fire
- item system similar to LoL (basic items that combine in bigger ones with different passives)



To Do
====

- ~~MAKE IT SO THAT CAMERA SNAPS TO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM IN CASE IT IS NOT ALLIGNED~~

- ~~L ROOMS WILL NOT SPAWN WHERE THERE IS ANOTHER ROOM IN THE MISSING CORNER~~

- ADD 2X2 ROOMS AND 1X2 ROOMS ?

- ~~add a square to the player that only interacts with the camera movement zones~~ 

- Make a starting room

- ~~Make camera transition smoothly between rooms~~
